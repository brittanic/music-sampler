<p>Drake is a Canadian musician that has been prominent in the Hip-Hop industry for the last 10 years. He first got his start in entertainment during his teenage years for his appearance on the hit television series Degrassi in his role as most popularly known as "Wheelchair Jimmy". Some critics in the industry would argue that some of his best music came earlier in his discography, which is why I have sampled work from his first four projects. Although Drake is a rapper, I really enjoy that he sings on some of his records. His voice brings a very relaxing presence to his body of work. Over time, he has evolved into being a much better singer which has allowed him to compete with RnB musicians. Check out some of his music below.</p>
